bio = "Michelle's passions are in design, education, and social impact which are directly related to her love for connection with the world and helping those in need. Her thirst for knowledge and connecting seemingly unrelated topics strengthens and overcompensates for her limited reach in arm span, walking stride, and near-sighted vision. Her dream is to become a leader in the world of design, government, and technology who will impact, inspire and influence positive change in the world."
