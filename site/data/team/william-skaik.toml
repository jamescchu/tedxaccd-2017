bio = "William Van Skaik is a multidisciplinary graphic designer, who just graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from Art Center College of Design. Do not let his good looks fool you, for underneath his physical appearance contains a variety of strange hobbies and interests. His main source of inspiration comes form his addiction to fantasy and storytelling, and when he is not working, he can often be found reading Japanese manga, drawing cartoons, or writing short stories about characters roaming through fantasized worlds. Today, William's body remains trapped here on Earth, while his mind continues to drift from one alternative universe to another, never letting himself forget the things that make him unique and different from others."
